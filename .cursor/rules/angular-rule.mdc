## Project Context
- Angular 20 using standalone components and new features
- TypeScript with strict typing enabled
- Functional reactive patterns preferred (signals, pipes)
- Strong typing with interfaces and type safety
- Avoid any, prefer explicit and narrow types

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- File names in kebab-case

## Component Rules
- Use standalone components wherever possible
- Use inject() function for dependency injection inside setup logic
- Prefer pure functions and signals for state management over mutable state
- Use Angular Signals and RxJS operators for reactive data flow
- Use typed Inputs and Outputs with interfaces
## TypeScript Rules
- Always declare explicit types for variables and function signatures
- Avoid use of any; create custom types or interfaces
- Use readonly properties where possible
- Use template strings for multi-line strings
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## Code Style
- Use function names starting with verbs (e.g., fetchData)
- Short functions, single responsibility principle
- Use early return for conditional checks
- Use arrow functions for short callbacks (<=3 lines)
- Use space 4
## Example Angular Component Rule:
- use @if, @for,....

## Folder rules
- Services is creating in src/app/services folder
- Interfaces is creating in src/app/interfaces folder
- All apis is creating in api-service.ts

## Style rules
- Use tailwind css
- Button Gradient duotone style, size medium
- default font-size as text-sm 
- default input styles as px-3 py-3

# html rules
- export all svg to src/assets/svgs
